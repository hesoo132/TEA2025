# 🎵 TEA2025 Stereo Amplifier Project

## 🔎 Overview
This project implements a **stereo audio amplifier circuit** based on the **TEA2025 IC**.  
The amplifier takes low-level audio signals (e.g., from a smartphone or MP3 player) and boosts them to drive external speakers.  
It was designed and simulated as part of the course **“컴퓨터를 이용한 회로 설계”**, showcasing practical analog circuit design skills.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Core IC**: TEA2025 dual-channel audio amplifier
- **Stereo Input**: Left (L) and Right (R) channels via coupling capacitors
- **Stable Power Supply**: External DC input with filtering capacitors and LED power indicator
- **Amplified Output**: Delivers audio to external speakers with DC protection
- **Gain & Stability**: Feedback capacitors for gain control, ripple rejection for noise reduction
- **Compact Design**: Minimal external components required thanks to TEA2025 integration
