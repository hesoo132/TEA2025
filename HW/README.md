# 🎵 TEA2025 Stereo Amplifier  

## 🔎 Overview
This project implements a **stereo audio amplifier circuit** based on the **TEA2025 IC**.  
It takes low-level audio input signals (e.g., from a smartphone or MP3 player) and amplifies them to drive external speakers.  
The design was created as part of the course **“컴퓨터를 이용한 회로 설계 (15주차 과제)”**.
